  bio         : "I am currently a PhD student at the NYU Center for Data Science, advised by Kyunghyun Cho
                 and Richard Bonneau. I develop Machine Learning algorithms to predict gene regulatory networks
                 from genome-wide sequencing data. Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a research analyst in the
                 Center for Computational Biology at the Simon's Foundation's Flatiron Institute. I hold a Bachelors
                 of Science in Mathematics from the University of Miami."
