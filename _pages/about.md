Hi there! My name is Claudia. I am a second year PhD student at NYU's Center for Data Science, co-advised by 
Kyunghyun Cho and Richard Bonneau. I work on developing algorithms to infer gene regulatory networks from genome-wide 
sequencing data. 

Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a research analyst in the Center for Computational Biology at the Simons 
Foundation's Flatiron Institute from 2018 to 2021. I hold a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics from the University of Miami.

My hobbies include training for marathons, cooking, photography, traveling and reading.
