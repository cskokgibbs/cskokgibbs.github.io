Hi there! I'm a fourth year PhD student at NYU's Center for Data Science, co-advised by 
Kyunghyun Cho and Richard Bonneau. My research focuses on developing algorithms to infer gene regulatory networks from genome-wide 
sequencing data. My current work uses a variational inference approach to GRN inference by leveraging probabilistic matrix factorization.
My research is supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF-GRFP).

I have worked as a PhD intern at Genentech in the Sequence Modeling and Regulatory Element Design Group. Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a research analyst in the Center for Computational Biology at the Simons Foundation's Flatiron Institute from 2018 to 2021. I hold a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics from the University of Miami.

Outside of research, I enjoy training for marathons, cooking, photography, travelling and reading.
