I am currently a PhD student at the NYU Center for Data Science, advised by Kyunghyun Cho and Richard Bonneau. 
I develop Machine Learning algorithms to predict gene regulatory networks from genome-wide sequencing data.
Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a research analyst in the Center for Computational Biology at the Simon's 
Foundation's Flatiron Institute. I hold a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics from the University of Miami.
