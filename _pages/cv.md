Work experience
======
* Research Analyst in the Center for Computational Biology : Simons Foundation | Flatiron Institute (2018-2021)
  * Designed algorithms to predict gene regulatory network interactions from genome-wide data
    * Developed, optimized, and maintained software pertaining to the network inference method the Inferelator
    * Adapted the Inferelator software to newly developed single-cell sequencing technologies
    * Explored and implemented mathematical models for exploratory analysis of biological data and estimation of latent biophysical parameters unable to be quantified using current sequencing technologies.
    * Developed Python software for implementing computing techniques such as multiprocessing and Dask analytic engine, which parallelizes computational cores on high-performance clusters at the Simons Foundation
    * Identified appropriate experimental designs for inferring gene regulatory networks to answer biological questions at hand within the following organisms: B. subtilis, S. cerevisiae, M. musculus, and D. melanogaster
    * Collaborated with wet-lab scientists in the Desplan Lab to infer single-cell gene regulatory networks within several time points and cell types of the developing Drosophila Optic lobe

* Research Intern in the Center for Computational Biology : Simons Foundation | Flatiron Institute (Summer 2017)
  * Data cleaning: used Python and R to convert raw unstructured data into organized data-frames for analysis
    * Manipulated large Twitter datasets of over 250GB through parallel processing
  * Quantitative text analysis: performed sentiment analysis using dictionary-based methods
  * Inferential statistics: modeled trends in sentiment following key political events (e.g., the 2016 U.S. presidential election) through non-parametric enrichment analyses 
  * Data visualization:
      * Plotted non-parametric enrichment results to display trends in sentiment in reaction to key political events
      * Designed multidimensional heat maps to compare the strength of ideological and event related influences on the content of a speaker’s language over time

* Investment Banking Summer Analyst : Atlas Advisors (Summer 2016)
  * Performed holistic analysis of a U.S. accessible luxury company to determine the optimal strategy for operating the company
    * Constructed a three-statement DCF projection model 
    * Estimated company’s weighted average cost of capital and valued cash flows by DCF
    * Conducted trading multiples valuation of target
    * Analyzed historical and projected sources and uses of cash to determine the optimal use of surplus cash
    * Analyzed EVA to determine target’s value creation for shareholders 
  * Assisted in the creation of strategic alternatives presentation for a separate U.S. accessible luxury company
  * Analyzed U.K. bid premiums in public transactions over $100MM since 2013

* Investment Banking Summer Analyst : Atlas Advisors (Summer 2015)
  * Researched and profiled personal care multilevel marketing companies in emerging markets 
  * Analyzed and developed financial projections to value a Peruvian department store company using discounted cash flows and comparable company trading multiples
